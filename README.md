# o.p.i

O.P.I - One Printer Interface budnles the API's of multiple Print-Servers
like Octoprint and Klipper/Moonraker in a single Web-UI.
You can easily monitor and control multiple Printers from the same UI and
O.P.I. will take care of translating your commands to the corresponding print-server.

An Instance of O.P.I. is hosted on Github Pages: https://jappyjan.github.io/o.p.i./
Because O.P.I. does NOT need nor use any other api than the one of your print-server(s) of choice
there is also no data storage outside your browser a.k.a. "pure Data-Privacy".
